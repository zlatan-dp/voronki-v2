        <h3>SUBSCRIPTION TERMS</h3>
        <h4>1. Free trial</h4>
        <p>
          We may offer a free trial subscription for service. Unless you cancel
          at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial, you will be
          automatically charged a price indicated on the payment screen for a
          chosen subscription period.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Subscription</h4>
        <p>
          The subscription renews automatically at the end of each period (each
          week, month, 6 months, year, or otherwise, depending on the option
          selected by you at the time of purchase) until you cancel.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Payment method</h4>
        <p>
          Payment will be charged to the payment method you submitted at the
          time of purchase at confirmation of purchase. You authorize us to
          charge the applicable subscription fees to the payment method that you
          submit.
        </p>
        <h4>4. Cancellation</h4>
        <p>
          Canceling your subscription means that the automatic renewal will be
          disabled, but you will still have access to all your subscription
          features for the remaining time of your then-current period. Note that
          deleting the app does not cancel your subscriptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you purchased a subscription or enabled free trial on App Store:
          You can cancel a free trial or a subscription anytime by turning-off
          autorenewal through your Apple ID account settings. To avoid being
          charged, cancel the subscription in your Apple ID account settings at
          least 24 hours before the end of the free trial or then-current
          subscription period. You alone can manage your subscriptions. Learn
          more about managing subscriptions (and how to cancel them) on Apple
          support page.

          hours before the end of the free trial or then-current subscription
          period. You alone can manage your subscriptions. Learn more about
