          subscriptions, what is the most popular users’ reading goal, what is
          the average time spent by users on reading); (2) serve ads (and to
          show them only to a particular group of users, for example, to

          Facebook Custom Audience we may create a list of users with certain
          sets of data, such as an IDFA, choose users that have completed
          certain actions in App (for example, installed it). As a result, we
          may ask Facebook to show some ads to a particular list of users. As a
          result, more of our ads may show up while you are using Facebook or
