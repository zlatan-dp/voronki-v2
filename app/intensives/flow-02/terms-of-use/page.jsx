        </p>
        <p>
          4.3 We retain the right to implement any changes to the Services

          described as “permanent,” “lifetime,” “one-time” (in the case of
          availability for an indefinite time after purchase) or using similar
          terms, this means they will remain available until ChatMND ceases to
          commercially offer them. You acknowledge and agree that such
          “permanent,” “lifetime,” “one-time” (in the case of availability for
          an indefinite time after purchase) or similarly described Additional

          Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.3 The Services may contain links to third party websites or

          provides these Third-Party Ads only as a convenience and does not
          review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any
          representations with respect to Third-Party Ads. Advertisements and
          other information provided by Third-Party Ads may not be wholly
          accurate. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk
          arising from your use of any such websites or resources. When you link
          to a third-party website, the applicable service provider's terms and
          policies, including privacy and data gathering practices govern. You
          should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate
          before proceeding with any transaction with any third party. Your
          transactions and other dealings with Third-Party Ads, including

          immediately prior subscription period, excluding any promotional and
          discount pricing, unless we notify you of a rate change prior to your

        </p>
        <h4>12. International Use</h4>
        <p>
          ChatMND makes no representation that the Services are accessible,
          appropriate or legally available for use in your jurisdiction, and
          accessing and using the Services is prohibited from territories where
          doing so would be illegal. You access the Services at your own
          initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.
        </p>
        <h4>13. Mandatory Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h4>
        <p>
          13.1 Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. You and ChatMND agree that any
          dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these
          Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
          validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “Disputes”)
          will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in
          a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and
          ChatMND agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the
          interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and
          ChatMND are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
          participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall
          survive termination of these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          13.2 Exceptions. As limited exceptions to Section 14: (i) we both may
          seek to resolve a Dispute in local court if it qualifies; and (ii) we
          each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief
          from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or
          misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          13.3 Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration
          will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”)
          under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect,
          except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at
          www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778- 7879. A party who wishes to start
          arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and
          give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA
          provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org. Any arbitration
          hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live,
          unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that
          the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues
          relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and
          scope of this arbitration agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          13.4 Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and
          arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek
          to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible
          for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we
          prevail in arbitration, we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs
          and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration
          you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to
          the extent provided under applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
          13.5 Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section
          13.1 above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on
          the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award
          declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
          seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
          warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or
          we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is,
          injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of
          prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public),
          the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a
          civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The
          parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive
          relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any
          individual claims in arbitration.
        </p>
        <p>
          13.6 Class Action Waiver. YOU AND CHATMND AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING
          CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND
          NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
          REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is
          resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate
          another person’s claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside
          over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this
          specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then entire Section
          13 shall be null and void.
        </p>
        <h4>14. Governing Law and Venue</h4>
        <p>
          14.1 These Terms shall be governed in accordance with the laws of the
          Republic of Cyprus (excluding its body of law governing conflicts of
          law).
        </p>
        <p>
          14.2 To the extent that any action relating to any dispute hereunder
          is for whatever reason not submitted to arbitration, each of the
          parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction to the courts of the
          Republic of Cyprus to settle any disputes which may arise out of or in
          connection with this Terms and that accordingly proceedings must be
          brought in such courts. The parties irrevocably waive any defenses of
          improper venue or forum non convenience.

          15.1 No delay or omission by us in exercising any of our rights
          occurring upon any noncompliance or default by you with respect to

          thereof, and a waiver by ChatMND of any of the covenants, conditions
