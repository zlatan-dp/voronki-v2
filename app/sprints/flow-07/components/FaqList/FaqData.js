    question: "What exactly am I buying?",
    answer:
      "You’re getting one subscription that includes a personalized 30-day plan plus premium access to a bundle of 3–4 apps matched to your quiz results (the apps shown on this screen).",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Why is it a bundle instead of just one app?",
    answer:
      "Most goals need more than one tool. The bundle combines a few focused services so you don’t have to hunt, compare, and manage multiple separate subscriptions.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Which apps are included in my bundle?",
    answer:
      "Your bundle includes the 3–4 apps displayed on this paywall — selected based on your quiz results. Bundles can differ from person to person.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Can I choose different apps instead?",
    answer:
      "Not on this screen. The bundle is pre-matched to your results to keep the experience simple and avoid “endless choosing.” If you want a different outcome, you can retake the quiz.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "What happens right after I subscribe?",
    answer:
      "You’ll get access to your 30-day plan and clear activation steps for each included app so you can unlock premium without guessing what to do next.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "How do I activate the bundle apps?",
    answer:
      "You’ll get setup steps to unlock premium in each included app after you subscribe.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "I already subscribe to one of these apps — what then?",
    answer:
      "You can still use the bundle for the other apps and the plan. For the app you already have, you’ll keep your existing subscription unless you cancel it separately.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Is this really cheaper than subscribing separately?",
    answer:
      "Yes — that’s the point of the bundle. Individual app prices vary, but one bundled subscription is designed to cost less than buying the same set one by one.",
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Where do I manage my subscription?",
    answer:
      "Inside your account (the same place you manage the subscription you used to purchase). You can view status, renewal date, and cancel anytime.",
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can cancel in your account settings. You’ll keep access until the end of your current billing period.",
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: "How does the discounted first month work?",
    answer:
      "The discounted price applies to your first subscription period. After the promo period ends, your subscription renews automatically at the regular monthly price unless you cancel. The regular price is shown below in the “Your bundle special price” section.",
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    question: "Will I be charged automatically?",
    answer:
      "Yes — your subscription renews automatically at the end of each billing cycle until you cancel in your account.",
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    question: "How much time does this take each day?",
    answer:
      "It depends on your goal, but the plan is designed to fit real schedules — typically short, doable steps rather than long sessions.",
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    question: "Can I use it on multiple devices?",
    answer:
      "In most cases, yes — as long as you’re signed into the same account. Some partner apps may have their own device rules.",
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    question: "Is my quiz data private?",
    answer:
      "We use your quiz answers to personalize your plan and app bundle. We don’t sell or share your personal data with third parties. For app-specific data, each app follows its own privacy policy.",
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    question: "Can I pause my subscription instead of canceling?",
    answer:
      "Usually subscriptions can’t be “paused,” but you can cancel anytime and re-subscribe later.",
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    question: "What happens if I cancel?",
    answer:
      "You keep access until the end of your paid period. After that, premium access ends and your plan may become limited until you subscribe again.",
  },
